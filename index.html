                            <p>Massachusetts is currently experiencing an epidemic of opioid-related overdose and death.</p>
                            <p>These overdoses are driven by the underlying chronic disease of opioid addiction or opioid use disorders. People with opioid addiction are at high risk of overdose and death.</p>
                            <p>Opioid-related deaths in the state were more than four times higher in 2015 than in 2000. This recent rate of increase is several times faster than anything seen here before. In 2013–2014 alone, opioid-related deaths occurred in two-thirds of the cities and towns in Massachusetts. </p>

                                    <dd>The term opioid means “opiate-like.” It generally refers to a family of substances that include natural opiates (like Morphine and Codeine), as well as synthetic and semi-synthetic opioids like Heroin, Oxycodone, and Fentanyl.</dd>
                                </dl>
                                <dl>
                                    <dt>Uses</dt>
                                    <dd>The most common medical use of opioids is in the treatment of pain across a broad spectrum, from acute post-surgical pain, to chronic pain in cancer patients, to end-of-life care. Opioids can also be misused, like taking a higher dosage of a painkiller than what a doctor prescribed. Other types of misuse can be unlawful, including taking heroin — which is illegal in all instances — or taking Oxycodone that has been legally prescribed to another person. This latter behavior, transferring drugs prescribed for one person to be used by someone else, is known as “diversion”.</dd>
                                </dl>
                                <dl>
                                    <dt>Side Effects</dt>
                                    <dd>
                                        Short-term side effects include drowsiness, depressed breathing, and euphoria. Long-term usage can trigger the body to develop tolerance, dependence, and addiction.
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Tolerance is the body’s natural response to the regular presence of a substance, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect.</li>
                                            <li>Dependence occurs when the body becomes so accustomed to the presence of a substance that its sudden absence causes withdrawal. For an opioid user, that could also mean that a prescription to address localized pain (a shoulder, a knee, a back) could cause pain all over the body if the prescription ends without tapering off.</li>
                                            <li>Addiction is a complex brain-body disease, where brain and body responses have changed to negatively and drastically affect behavior.

                                        <h4>What are opioids?</h4>
                                        <p>The term opioid means “opiate-like.” It generally refers to a family of substances that include natural opiates (like Morphine and Codeine), as well as synthetic and semi-synthetic opioids like Heroin, Oxycodone, and Fentanyl.</p>
                                    </div>

                                        <h4>What do opioids do?</h4>
                                        <p>The most common medical use of opioids is in the treatment of pain across a broad spectrum, from acute post-surgical pain, to chronic pain in cancer patients, to end-of-life care. Opioids can also be misused, like taking a higher dosage of a painkiller than what a doctor prescribed. Other types of misuse can be unlawful, including taking heroin — which is illegal in all instances — or taking Oxycodone that has been legally prescribed to another person. This latter behavior, transferring drugs prescribed for one person to be used by someone else, is known as “diversion”.</p>

                                        <h4>What are the side effects of using opioids?</h4>
                                        <p>Short-term side effects include drowsiness, depressed breathing, and euphoria. Long-term usage can trigger the body to develop tolerance, dependence, and addiction.</p>
                                        <ul class="neg-space-col">
                                            <li><strong>Tolerance</strong> is the body’s natural response to the regular presence of a substance, requiring higher doses to achieve the same effect.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Dependence</strong> occurs when the body becomes so accustomed to the presence of a substance that its sudden absence causes withdrawal. For an opioid user, that could also mean that a prescription to address localized pain (a shoulder, a knee, a back) could cause pain all over the body if the prescription ends without tapering off.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Addiction</strong> is a complex brain-body disease, where brain and body responses have changed to negatively and drastically affect behavior. This often includes an irresistible compulsion for short-term relief even in the face of both immediate and long-term risk.</li>

                            <p>However, economic impact is hardly the most negative aspect of addiction and, more specifically, the opioid epidemic. Addiction to opioids can put people at greater risk for infectious diseases like HIV or hepatitis, deteriorating conditions like cirrhosis or cognitive decline, family disruption like domestic violence or child abuse, job loss, exposure to criminal behavior, overdose, and death.</p>

                            <p>Opioids are incredibly powerful drugs that have transformed the way the health care world treats and manages pain.

In 2015, nearly one in six Massachusetts residents obtained an opioid prescription from a health care provider.

                            <p>Whether using them for legitimate medical reasons or not, anyone can become dependent on or addicted to opioids. When this happens, the body’s craving for an opioid continues even if a prescription runs out. In these cases, many people keep using opioids, but illegally. More than <a class="controls controls-svg" onclick="_gaq.push(['b._trackEvent', 'intext', 'clicked', 'rx-history-2thirds'])" data-select="2/3">two-thirds</a> of people who died from an opioid-related overdose had a legal opioid prescription at some point from 2011–2014.

                            <p>It should be noted that opioid-related deaths began increasing sharply in 2012, no similar increase in opioid prescriptions was recorded.

                            <h2>Multiple Prescribers</h2>
                            <p>One risk factor for fatal overdose that was identified was the number of opioid prescribers for an individual. There are legitimate reasons why someone might have multiple prescribers — primary care plus specialists<a href="#footnote-18" class="page-scroll" aria-describedby="footnote-label"><span class="sr-only">see footnote</span><sup>18</sup></a> or multi-provider practices<a href="#footnote-19" class="page-scroll" aria-describedby="footnote-label"><span class="sr-only">see footnote</span><sup>19</sup></a> — but there is an elevated risk for this group. The fatal opioid-related overdose rate for individuals with three or more opioid prescribers is seven times higher than the rate for other people.</p>
                            <h2>Multiple Substances</h2>
                            <p>Using multiple substances at the same time is also a risk factor. For example, Cocaine showed up in 30% of toxicology screens for opioid-related deaths from 2013–2014. Nearly 60% of post-mortem toxicology screens were positive for benzodiazepines. Benzodiazepines are a type of tranquilizer, including drugs like Valium, Xanax, and Ativan, and are typically used to treat anxiety.</p>
                            <p>While Cocaine is always illegal, benzodiazepines are legally available but might be used outside a prescription. Although benzodiazepines were present in nearly 1,000 toxicology screens from 2011–2014, only about half that many people ever had a prescription for one during that period. Fewer than 200 had a benzodiazepine prescription within a month of death. This suggests that the supply of benzodiazepines involved in overdoses includes both prescribed and diverted pills.</p>

                            <h2>Illegal Drugs</h2>
                            <p>When it comes to illegal opioids, Massachusetts is facing a dangerous combination of trends. Some individuals are transitioning from legal to illegal opioid use, perhaps due to dependence and addiction developing beyond prescribed thresholds. At the same time, the availability of illegal drugs is strengthening across the region. The Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) surveyed law enforcement officials about the availability of Heroin in eight regions across the country from 2007 to 2014<a href="#footnote-20" class="page-scroll" aria-describedby="footnote-label"><span class="sr-only">see footnote</span><sup>20</sup></a>. Each year, New England led all regions in the percentage of respondents who reported high Heroin availability</p>
                            <p>Heroin, perhaps expectedly, is commonly found in toxicology reports for opioid-related deaths. Data from 2013–2014 shows Heroin was likely or definitely in the individual's system at the time of death in more than 60% of opioid-related overdose deaths. What might be surprising is the increasingly deadly role Fentanyl is playing in the crisis.</p>
                            <p>While Fentanyl can be available as a legally-prescribed medication, it is most often used illegally. Only about 3% of people who died from an opioid-related overdose and had Fentanyl present in their toxicology screen during the study period had a prescription for Fentanyl at the time of death. However, toxicology data shows Heroin, Fentanyl, or both substances were present in 85% of cases.</p>

                                <p>Fentanyl is an opioid that can be prescribed for pain management. However, it’s also used illegally either on its own or combined with Heroin, often without the user's knowledge. According to the DEA, illegally produced Fentanyl can be up to 50 times more potent than Heroin. Fentanyl is increasingly recognized as a problem across the United States, and particularly in Massachusetts. Toxicology data from recent post-mortem cases indicates <span class="fentanyl_">Fentanyl</span> is adding to the state’s deadly epidemic more than <span class="heroin_">Heroin</span>.

                            <p>Opioid addiction doesn’t discriminate. The crisis in Massachusetts affects people from all backgrounds. The widespread nature of the epidemic makes addressing it an especially challenging task, because the path to opioid addiction has different starting points from person to person. While definite solutions might still be a mystery, knowing how the epidemic plays out among different sections of society can help Massachusetts find ways to strongly and effectively address this problem.</p>

                            <p>The fight to curb the opioid epidemic in Massachusetts is also a battle to protect future generations. The percentage of opioid-related deaths for different age groups shows the young people of Massachusetts are especially at risk. From 2013–2014, opioids accounted for more than a quarter of all fatalities in the <a id="age18to24" onclick="_gaq.push(['b._trackEvent', 'intext', 'clicked', 'demo-age-18-24'])">18–24</a> age group. For individuals from <a id="age25to34" onclick="_gaq.push(['b._trackEvent', 'intext', 'clicked', 'demo-age-25-34'])">25–34</a>, opioids were responsible for more than a third of all deaths, rising to more than 40% for men in this group. In 2015, roughly two out of every three people who died from opioids were younger than 45.</p>

                            <h2>Race and Ethnicity</h2>
                            <p>In 2000, the rate of opioid-related fatal overdose was 5.8 per 100,000 people in Massachusetts, according to DPH data. That rate has increased steadily since then, with the figure hitting 11.1 per 100,000 in 2012. However, the increase in the last three years has been especially sharp. By 2015, there were 23.3 fatal overdoses for every 100,000 residents.</p>
                            <p>While the death rate within Massachusetts differs for various racial and ethnic groups, people from all backgrounds in the Bay State are caught up in the deadly epidemic. In the adjoining graph, we can see the overdose rates of three of the state’s largest groups for the last two years. By comparison, the national average was 9.7 per 100,000 in 2014. As seen in the graph, the age-adjusted, normalized data reveals that the epidemic is hitting the White non-Hispanic population at a rate around twice that of Black non-Hispanic population for the last two years, and roughly 50% more than the rate for the Hispanic population over that time.</p>

                                        <p>Using age-adjusted data is important because different groups have different age distributions, whether those groups are broken out by racial/ethnic, gender, or geographic lines. For example, the Hispanic population in Massachusetts is relatively younger than other racial/ethnic groups in the state. Without taking age distribution into account, the fact that younger people are more likely to die from opioid-related overdoses could result in an over-estimated death rate for the Hispanic community as a whole. We might experience similar mischaracterization when looking at cities and towns that skew older or younger than the rest of the state. In these ways and others, age-adjusting population data helps public health officials get a more accurate picture of the crisis and better target the most problematic areas and populations.</p>

                                        <p>Statisticians use confidence intervals to indicate the level of certainty of a measurement by showing a range of likely results. Analyzing a population is often done by looking at samples that are intended to be representative of the whole group. It is easier to assess whether that representation is accurate when the sample size is larger. For example, it is easier to trust the results of a survey with thousands of respondents than a survey with only a dozen respondents. So, adjusted for different sample sizes, confidence intervals show the precision of different results. </p>
                                        <p>When counts are smaller, rates are less precise and confidence intervals are wider. Larger samples have narrower ranges. Note that the confidence intervals on the rates for the Black non-Hispanic category are much wider than those around the rates for the White non-Hispanic category. This is because fewer non-Hispanic Blacks are dying from opioid-related overdoses than non-Hispanic Whites, so their sample size is smaller.</p>
                                        <p>When comparing two results, you can only be sure that there is truly a difference when the confidence intervals do not overlap. An example of this is seen in the death rates for the Black non-Hispanic and Hispanic populations. While the projections look higher for 2015, since the confidence intervals overlap, we can’t be sure that the numbers are significantly different from 2014 because the results could fall anywhere within either overlapping range.</p>

                                        <p>When doing population analysis, statisticians will often use a rate per sample size (example: rate per 100,000), rather than just a raw count. Densely populated areas are more likely to show many types of behavior, whether good or bad, because there are simply more people. Using raw count, the largest cities would always show up as hot spots and probably draw the most focus and resources. By contrast, a raw count change from 100 to 200 in a city of 1 million (was 0.01%, now 0.02%) might not seem as significant as the same change in a town of 2,000 (was 5%, now 10%).</p>
                                        <p>For example, since the White non-Hispanic population is larger in Massachusetts than other similar groups, if we just went by raw count, we couldn’t be sure whether the higher number of opioid-related deaths reflected a larger problem, or just a larger sample. By normalizing all the rates to the same sample size, we can properly compare groups to see that the problem is truly more prevalent among non-Hispanic Whites than among other groups.</p>
                                        <p>Comparing apples to apples by standardizing to a normalized rate helps public health officials get a more accurate picture so they can develop the right strategies to combat the epidemic.</p>

                            <p>When an inmate is released from prison in Massachusetts, their ability to re-enter society is being threatened by the opioid crisis. The risk of opioid-related death following release from incarceration is more than 50 times greater than for the general public. What’s more concerning is that the threat is immediate. Fatal overdoses during the first month after release are six times higher than for all other post-incarceration periods. </p>
                            <p>Among inmates who both were released and died between 2013 and 2014, opioid-related overdose was the cause of death for 40% of these people. Following the age trend noted above, the risk of death for people aged 18–24 in this group is roughly 10 times higher than for individuals 45 or older. While some inmates receive substance use treatment while incarcerated, the data from this study does not include how, when, or for how long that treatment takes place.</p>

                            <p>The opioid epidemic won’t be solved overnight, and there’s no easy solution to make this problem disappear. However, there are signs of hope and a turning tide.</p>
                            <p>The state has recently taken a number of important steps to address the crisis. From campaigns aimed at shifting the culture around how the public views addiction, to giving our health care professionals the tools they need to responsibly prescribe opioids and monitor prescriptions, Massachusetts is working to end the epidemic.</p>
                            <p>While there is still a lot to do, findings from the Chapter 55 report have helped elected officials and public health leaders determine what should be done next.</p>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Stopping Stigma</strong> — Shifting the way that people view addiction and individuals with substance use issues is a top priority. DPH launched the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/stop-addiction/state-without-stigma/" target="_blank">State Without StigMA</a> campaign to encourage the public to rethink how they perceive and treat people with addiction. Stories from people in recovery — like <a class="controls controls-video js-play-video" onclick="_gaq.push(['b._trackEvent', 'intext', 'clicked', 'video-sue'])" data-target="Sue"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-facetime-video hidden-sm hidden-xs"  aria-hidden="true"></span> Sue and Stephanie</a>, and <a class="controls controls-video js-play-video" onclick="_gaq.push(['b._trackEvent', 'intext', 'clicked', 'video-cotto'])" data-target="Cotto"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-facetime-video hidden-sm hidden-xs"  aria-hidden="true"></span> Cotto</a> — have helped reframe addiction as the disease it is.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Promoting the Good Samaritan Law</strong> — Another state campaign, <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/departments/dph/programs/substance-abuse/make-the-right-call-public-information-campaign.html" target="_blank">Make the Right Call</a>, has helped spread awareness about the state’s Good Samaritan Law. It ensures a person won’t be charged with possession of a controlled substance if they call 9-1-1 to report an overdose.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Prescription Monitoring Reforms</strong> — To help pharmacists and doctors better monitor active opioid prescriptions, DPH launched the <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/newsroom/press-releases/dph/admin-launches-new-prescription-monitoring-program.html" target="_blank">Massachusetts Prescription Awareness Tool (MassPAT)</a>. This new online system is more efficient and user-friendly than older technologies.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Expanding Prescription Drug Training</strong> — More resources and programs have been offered to <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/newsroom/press-releases/eohhs/dental-core-competencies-to-combat-addiction-announced.html" target="_blank">dental schools</a> and <a href="http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/gov/newsroom/press-releases/eohhs/core-competencies-to-combat-opioid-epidemic-expanded-.html" target="_blank">nursing and physician assistant programs</a> to train students and professionals on how to prevent prescription drug misuse.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </div>
                                    <div class="tab-pane" id="tab_h">
                                        <p></p>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><strong>Expand OAT Treatment</strong> — One of the findings from Chapter 55 was that opioid agonist treatment (OAT) can lower the ongoing risk for opioid-related death if it follows a non-fatal overdose. Developing a strategy to effectively deliver OAT could reduce the number of opioid-related deaths in the state.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Consider Gender</strong> — Substance use trends differ depending on gender. This information can be used when developing prevention programs for both men and women. For example, working with pharmacists to create education and coordinated care strategies targeted at female patients could reduce the percentage of women who have multiple prescribers.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Develop Post-incarceration Treatment Plan</strong> — The short-term risk for opioid-related death is much higher for individuals who were recently released from prison. Creating treatment programs that target this population may help curb the epidemic.</li>
                                            <li><strong>Continue Using Data</strong> — The Chapter 55 legislation itself is an incredible tool. By continuing to share and look at different datasets, Massachusetts can gain even more insight into the epidemic and how it is changing. Public health leaders can then develop solutions based on the latest trends, enabling the state to stay ahead of the problem.</li>

                <ol>
                    <li id="footnote-1">The confirmed opioid-related death rate was suppressed in towns that were detected as strong outliers using Tukey’s outlier filter. All values that fell outside of the upperbound, calculated using three times the interquartile range, were considered strong outliers. Rates for Provincetown, Cummington, and Granville were suppressed from 2001 to 2005. Rates for Aquinnah, New Ashford, and Tyringham were suppressed from 2011 to 2015.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-2">In both 2014 and 2015, there was one death of a Massachusetts resident whose city/town of residence was not known.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-3">Please note that data for 2000-2013 have been updated following a review of cases that did not receive an official cause of death at the time the file was closed. Death data for 2014-2015 are preliminary and subject to updates. Case reviews of deaths are evaluated and updated on an ongoing basis. A large number of death certificates have yet to be assigned final cause-of-death codes. These counts are based on the estimates rather than confirmed cases.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-4">Cases were defined using the International Classification of Disease, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) codes for mortality. The following codes were selected from the underlying cause of death field to identify poisonings/overdoses: X40-X49, Y10-Y19. All multiple cause of death fields were then used to identify an opioid-related death: T40.0, T40.1, T40.2, T40.3, T40.4, and T40.6.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-5">The average annual opioid-related death rate was calculated in five-year intervals. The death rate displayed is the crude, non age-adjusted rate.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-6">In 1999, the International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision (ICD-10) replaced the International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision (ICD-9) for coding all mortality data. Because there were changes made in the codes that are assigned to causes of death, changes to the rules used to determine the underlying cause of death, and changes in the codes that comprise the leading cause of death categories, direct comparisons of causes of death between 1999 and previous years cannot be made.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-7">The Massachusetts age-adjusted opioid-related death rate was provided by the Massachusetts Department of Public Health.</li>

                    <li id="footnote-16">"Both Fentanyl and Heroin" includes Fentanyl, Heroin, and Morphine (likely Heroin).</li>
                    <li id="footnote-17">"Legal opioid prescription" includes any prescription for Fentanyl, Methadone, Hydrocodone, Hydromorphone, Oxycodone, Oxymorphone, Morphine, or Codeine.</li>
                    <li id="footnote-18">Some individuals may see a primary care physician who then directs them to a specialist, depending on the medical issue. In some cases, both the primary physician and specialist may provide opioids to the patient for various reasons, including for immediate pain relief. Emergency room visits might also fall under this category.
